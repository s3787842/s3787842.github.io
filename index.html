											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										
										<p> I was born in Townsville, Queensland and lived there all up through until I finished my schooling in 2017. 
										I then moved to Brisbane to pursue a university degree in engineering but found it wasn't for me and worked for the rest of 2018.
										Nearing the end of 2018 I decided I would go back to university but pursue a career in IT instead and moved to Melbourne.  
										An interesting fact about me is that I absolutely love travelling. I have been all over Europe and also visited Japan (Japan was definitely my favorite). </p> 
										<header class="major">
										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										<p> My interest in IT started when I was in high school and did a class on programming. It definitely sparked my interest and I've loved computers ever since.
										Although this class taught me little, with us only working on very basic programs and games it was intriguing to me to the point where I built my own computer. 
										What I did in that class and what I've pursued in my sparetime is as far as my experience goes but I have spent many hours on my computer in the past years and believe that I have a decent understanding of IT and what it entails.</p>
										<p>The main reason I chose to study at RMIT is that there IT course is highly regarded and when I compared it to other universities that I could attend, I believed RMIT would be my best choice as they offered the highest standard of teaching.
										I also have a close friend that attends RMIT and he regards it highly and recommended it to me. </p>
										<p> Going into this course my expectations were that I will gain a much clearer and informed understanding of what exactly IT is and how
										it differs from other courses such as Computer Science and Software Engineering. I also expect that I'll be able to effectively write and understand different programs in different
										software languages such as Java.

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>My current ideal job is working in cloud security as I find anything related to cloud technology quite interesting and 
								I think the security side of cloud technology is just as interesting. Jobs relating to cloud technology usually pay well
								and these jobs require a multitude of skills and that you are proficient in all ensuring that I will never be bored of the job and will always
								have something new to experience and learn. Cloud is always constantly evolving and improving as well as being implemented into more systems which will most
								likely mean that jobs will never run short that are related to cloud systems and technology. </p>
								<p>For the job of "Senior Analyst Cloud Security Engineer" there are many different skills that I will need to acquire before I am able to pursue this job.
								I will obviously need to be well versed in cloud services including open source technology, software development, scripting languages relating to cloud services, system engineering and have worked in multiple cloud provider environments.
								Have 3 years experience in these fields is a prerequisite and having 5 years is highly regarded. Having an understanding of Python and Google, AWS or Azure is also a necessary requirement along with working with cloud security previously.
								Knowledge of version control, staging and testing and Jenkins is required and I must have proven security design and implementation experience. </p>
								<p>As shown, I will need vast amounts of experience before I can enter into a job in this field. I am currently very inexperienced and have very limited knowledge on cloud services and cloud security.
								I am completely new to Google, AWS and Azure and have never worked with Python before. My knowledge of version control, staging and testing and Jenkins is nil and I have no proven experience with security design and implementation.</p>
								<p>Ideally, I will obtain some of these skills during my IT degree but many of them will need to be attained through personal experience in the workforce.
								I hope to learn about Python during my degree along with Google, AWS or Azure. Taking courses that will give me insight into cloud services and security will also
								prepare me for after graduation when I will need to attain jobs relating to cloud so I can secure the experience required to move into my ideal job.</p>

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>I did a series of tests including the Myer-Briggs test, a learning style test and an Empathy Quotient. The Myer-Briggs test showed that I am a mediator and am highly introverted.
									I see this result as a negative as I would like to be more extraverted and approachable in real life rather then quiet. My learning style was determined to be auditory which surprised me
									as I always believed myself to be a visual learner. On my final test, the Empathy Quotient, I scored a 44/80 which is around average for this kind of test. This showed me that I need
									to work on being more empathetic towards others and looking at things from others perspectives.</p>

									<a href="https://psychology-tools.com/test/empathy-quotient">Empathy Test</a>
									</p>
									
									<p>I believe these traits could have a negative influence on my ability to work in a team based environment.
									I may lack the empathy required to effectively communicate and relate with my teammates, leading to conflict and a loss of respect between my peers.
									My introverted nature will possibly cause me to be outcast as I do not partake in group discussions and may fail to have any input in group work.
									</p>
									<p>When creating my team, I should consider these traits highly and attempt to choose a team that will include me in discussions which may result in me
									being more proactive within the team and having more input in discussions. I should also work on my empathy and get teammates who will tell me when something has
									offended them so I can try and reflect and improve upon it so I can gain the respect of my group.

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>My project idea is an application or program that allows users to calculate how many blocks or bricks would be required to create a structure, be it a larger building or just a house. The user would enter the necessary details such as the dimensions of the building, whether bricks or blocks are being used and the size of the materials. Things such as doors and windows would have to be accounted for by the user and in order to use the application and the entered details would have to be very accurate and specific. Once this is finished, the application will calculate and give an estimate on how many resources would be required.</p>
									<p>The reasoning behind choosing this project is because my father is a bricklayer and he is the one that suggested it to me. He is also the foreman of his worksites and is the one who must make the orders for materials for the current job. While there are programs that would allow for the calculations to be done, none of them are easy to use and require a lot of effort to use them for this purpose. Therefore, I believe this project would be useful and has a market that would use it.</p>
									<p>The main feature of this product would be its ability to give an accurate estimate on the number of blocks or bricks required to design a specific structure.
									The application would request user input and then it would make these calculations based on the user's responses. These details would include whether blocks or bricks are being used,
									all the required dimensions for the structure including door frames, windows and all other relevant areas where the blocks would not be going. After recieving all these details, the application would
									then make an accurate estimate as to the required resources. It would be critical to alert the user that this is just an estimate as there are many different scenarios that could affect the outcome
									and cause inaccuracies that are unavoidable. Another feature of the program could be a visual showing off what the machine believes the building will look like. It could create a model based off the previously entered dimensions
									and show the users what the final outcome may resemble. This may also help user's identify mistakes in their plans or when details have been incorrectly entered. In order to do this, the hardware running the application would have to be powerful
									which may make this part of the application not entirely plausible as it may be running on less powerful hardware, such as phones, and will not be able to produce a good result, causing more issues then good for the user. The application could also 
									potentially be able to not only account for blocks and bricks but also have options to give an estimate on other required materials. This would include glass for windows, the material for door and window frames and even possibly floorboards or benches.
									As this application is designed specifically for bricklayers, implementing these features may not provide useful to them but will open up the possibility for other professions to use the program such as carpenters or even just the general public who are attempting
									to build their own property. With this feature, there could also be an option for users to have a selection of different materials that the user desires and it would be able to list prices and compare between different stores locally and online. 
									In order to execute this, agreements with local hardware and other stores would be required. As they may not agree until the application is larger and they can see a demand for this, this feature could be left and implemented into the design later
									if the need or want arises from users. These are my current ideas for the application that I believe would be highly beneficial but many more may arise as development progresses and the need for certain features is discovered.
									</p>
									<p>To develop the software for this application, a modelling program would be a prerequisite. AutoCAD is what I believe would be the best solution as I have previous experience using it and have a good understanding of its capabilities
									and am certain it is an appropriate tool. The different sizes of blocks and bricks would already be implemented into the program and AutoCAD could model the structure using the dimensions and the dimensions of the blocks already coded into the program. 
									This would give an accurate estimate of the amount required for development of a project and also benefits the idea of showing a model to the user of what the finished structure may resemble.</p>
									<p>In order to begin creating this project, I would need to have an understanding of all the modelling programs available to me and also even obtain the skills required to write the software myself
									if existing programs such as AutoCAD do not have the capabilities required. If the application is put onto phones, a background in phone app development will also be necessary to create the project. 
									Knowledge on databases would also be of great benefit as implementing options such as different materials and pricing would need to be stored on a database that can be fetched whenever necessary.</p>
									<p>If this project is to succeed, I believe it could have a noticeable impact on the way worksites are ran and make developing structures much easier and efficient. The amount of wasted resources would also be reduced as excess materials will no longer be ordered,
									which in turn will also save money. Cases where not enough resources were ordered will also no longer exist, saving large amounts of time and speeding up developments. These are the reasons why I believe that my project idea is a worthwhile investment and would have a beneficial impact on the way
									not only companies run their worksites, but also on the way smaller businesses and everyday people design their own structures.
